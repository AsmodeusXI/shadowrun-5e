# Erza MacGee

## Story

Erza was born to the CEO of a powerful AA corporation that specialized in tech. Unfortunately for him, he Awakened at an early age. He refused the implants and mods that were his family speciality, preserving and perfecting his magical abilities instead. Needless to say, he and his father didn't get along too well.

Those disagreements probably helped fuel his propensity for mischief. He spent plenty of his youth sneaking around the Corp's offices, pretending to be someone he wasn't, stealing keycards to get into places he shouldn't, or generally making the wrong kind of trouble. The look on a hardened Corp operative's face when she realizes the boss's fourteen year-old son talked his way into meeting with Shadowrunners? Priceless.

It didn't help that Erza has a taste for old school style -- and doesn't mind making a big deal about it. "Oh sure Dad, your nice new SuperTechy PopGun 9000 is great, but have you seen these revolvers! Look at the size of these bullets! And it goes so well with this here hat..."

Not that he won't pop the latest and greatest whiz bang features into it. For Ezra, it's about style, not substance.

It finally came to a head when he came home with those new (admitedly badass) magical tatoos. Curses were screamed, furniture was thrown and ties were severed. It's not clear whether he disowned his family or they disowned him, but he walked out with little more than the clothes on his back.

He's spent the last few weeks living on the streets talking his way through whatever life throws at him. He's made friends with a street vendor and a fellow homeless person that shares his neighborhood. They may be nobodies like him, but surviving here brings people together, right? He also tries to keep in touch with his old talismonger and an old friend who works the IT service desk for his family's corporation.

Life on the streets is rough and Erza is getting desperate. As one of the Awakened, his first priority is a substantially better fake SIN before the cops look too closely at the new street mage. That means he needs to start earning. He did a little work with his family's corporation operating Shadowrunners. How hard can it be?
