# Erza MacGee

## Story

Erza was born to the CEO of a powerful AA corporation that specializes in tech. Unfortunately for him, he Awakened at an early age. He refused the implants and mods that are his family's speciality, preserving and perfecting his magical abilities instead. Needless to say, he and his father don't get along too well.

Those disagreements probably helped fuel his propensity for mischief. He spent plenty of his youth sneaking around the Corp's offices, pretending to be someone he wasn't, stealing keycards to get into places he shouldn't, or generally making the wrong kind of trouble. The look on a hardened Corp operative's face when she realizes the boss's fourteen year-old son talked his way into meeting with Shadowrunners? Priceless.

It didn't help that Erza has a taste for old school style -- and doesn't mind making a big deal about it. "Oh sure Dad, your nice new SuperTechy PopGun 9000 is great, but have you seen these revolvers! Look at the size of these bullets! And it goes so well with this here hat..."

Not that he won't pop the latest and greatest whiz bang features into it. For Ezra, it's about style, not substance.

It finally came to a head when he came home with those new (admitedly badass) magical tatoos. Curses were screamed, furniture was thrown and ties were severed. It's not clear whether he disowned his family or they disowned him, but he walked out with little more than the clothes on his back.

He's spent the last few weeks living on the streets talking his way through whatever life throws at him. He's made friends with a street vendor and a fellow street dweller that shares his neighborhood. They may be nobodies like him, but surviving here brings people together, right? He also tries to keep in touch with his old talismonger and an old friend who works the IT service desk for his family's corporation.

Life on the streets is rough and Erza is getting desperate. As one of the Awakened, his first priority is a substantially better fake SIN before the cops look too closely at the new street mage. That means he needs to start earning. He did a little work with his family's corporation operating Shadowrunners. How hard can it be?

##Contacts

| Job | Loyalty | Connection | Favor | Biography |
| --- | ------- | ---------- | ----- | --------- |
| Talismonger | 3 | 4 | n/a | Margie Dancing Crow resides in and around the Renton/Salish-Shidhe Council border area. Rumor has it that she knows both the fastest, and the quickest ways to cross that boundary without questions... |
| Street Vendor | 3 | 2 | n/a | Charle Botha is a South African immigrant. He always appreciates a heads up when Lone Star law enforcement might be sweeping through looking for reasons to crack skulls or do bribe shakedowns. |
| Homeless Person | 4 | 1 | n/a | Gobber has perhaps slightly less than half his teeth. The ones that remain appear only to stay affixed to his gums by sheer stubborn force. Not unlike Gobber himself. He may not have much (or anything, really), but you can always count on him to stash something for you, keep a secret, or play the insane drunkard when suits come asking after you. |
| Service Desk, Old Corp | 3 | 1 | n/a | Sidney Bester ("Captain Sid Vicious" on the forums) tries to keep half an ear open for any chatter from the head office concerning you. Level-1 help desk doesn't afford much in the way of real intel, but Sid says that if he hears anything, that he'll reach out to you. Oh, and if you ever hear of a decent job that isn't tied to wage-slaving for your "dickhole parents", he's all ears. |
